Chekote's Modpack v2, for Minecraft 1.7.2

#Mod List:

##Animated Player 1.4.1 by TheHippoMaster21

Do you love Minecraft's default animations? Are you obsessed with the way the Minecraft player looks and acts? Do you wish Minecraft's player would forever look the same way? Well if you do, then this isn't the mod for you!

After countless hours of working (it wasn't that long), Professor HippoMaster now introduces to you the Animated Player Mod! This mod completely replaces and reanimates the player model by adding more joints and better animations. Also, it's completely client-based, which means it works for servers too (just don't install it into the server)!

Animations:
Currently this mod replaces animations for walking, running, swimming, jumping, sneaking, riding, bow-aiming, blocking, climbing, hitting, eating, and drinking!

##Another One Bites The Dust 2.2.4 by Ganymedes01

â€‹AOBD has grown further than being a simple TIC add-on to allow Ardite and Cobalt processing. It now automatically detects every single ore from every single mod you have installed and creates the necessary dusts and etc in order for that metal to be processed on IC2, RailCraft's Rock Crusher and EnderIO's SAG Mill!

It also now adds Thaumcraft's Native Clusters for every possible ore! As soon as they are updated there will also be integration with Mekanism and ThermalExpansion!

##Better Horses 1.0.0 by TheHippoMaster21

Everyone loves horses! But sometimes, do you ever feel like some things could be improved? Do you feel like the horses' animations and behaviors seem a bit, might I say, too blocky? Don't you want smoother more horse-like animations? Then this is the mod for you!

Professor HippoMaster presents to you the Better Horses Mod! This mod replaces vanilla Minecraft's horses with similar new and improved horses! Although they look the exact same, these modded horses have many added and replaced animations as well as various minor fixes and improvements. You name it! From new animations to new animations to... yeah, that's about it.

Note, as of now, only adult horses and donkeys are animated.

Many original horse animations that looked choppy (tail swiping) have been replaced with slicker, more stylish animations while other new animations have been introduced to make the horse seem more natural! The animations are listed below:

* Walking
* Galloping (with rider)
* Tail shaking
* Grass eating
* Head shaking
* Rearing
* Jumping

##Blood Magic 1.1.0 by WayofTime

Have you ever picked up a magic mod for Minecraft, and thought that it was too tame? Was there not enough danger involved when creating your next high-tech gadget? Bored with all of those peaceful animals just staring at you without a care in the world? Well then, I am glad you came here!

Blood Magic is an arcane art that is practiced by mages who attempt to gather a vast amount of power through utilizing a forbidden material: blood. Even though it does grant a huge amount of power, every single action that is performed with this volatile magic can prove deadly. You have been warned.

##Carpenters Blocks 3.2.6 by Mineshopper

This mod adds slopes and a custom variety of vanilla-inspired blocks to the game!  They may look like ordinary frames or wooden blocks in their base form, but they can actually be covered with nearly any block in the game.  The frame will inherit the cover block's texture and most of it's other properties including flammability, explosion resistance, and more.

In addition to covering the block with almost anything, you can also overlay any of the blocks with grass, snow, hay, web, mycelium or vine!  Still not convinced?  Craft the Carpenter's Chisel and carve elaborate designs into any of the blocks.  Custom patterns can easily be added.

##Falling Meteors 2.13.1 by AlexDGr8r

##Gravestone Mod 2.9.3 by NightKosh

This mod adds a gravestone to the game, which "spawns" at player/villager/dog/cat death. Also this mod generates cemeteries in some villages, and the "Wither's catacombs".

##Mekanism 7.1.0.92 by Aiden Brady

Mekanism is an independent tech mod that brings low, mid, and high tier machinery to Minecraft. The mod doesnâ€™t have an actual goal, and youâ€™ll understand this when you see all the random content Mekanism contains, from jetpacks to balloons.  However, I can assure you that youâ€™ll notice all the content blend together as you get to know the mod better!

Mekanism uses a tier-based system when organizing several of its core features, including Energy Cubes and Factories. There are four tiers: basic, the simplest tier, advanced, the second-most basic tier, elite, the second-most complex tier, and ultimate, the most complex tier. You can upgrade tiers by placing the component in a crafting grid and surrounding it with the necessary resources for the next upgrade (I recommend NotEnoughItems!).

By the time youâ€™ve been using Mekanism for a while, youâ€™ll have a near-instructible suit of Obsidian Armor, be obtaining four ingots for each ore you mine, have the ability to fly wherever you want with the hydrogen-powered jetpacks, and have a cute robotic friend following you around while you mine. :)

##Microblocks 59.0.3 by Immibis

Multiples of these smaller pieces can then be placed in a single space that would traditionally only allow a single block, allowing you to build more complex structures with finer detail than would normally be possible in Minecraft.

##Mutant Creatures 1.4.5 by TheHippoMaster21

Gunpowder... Spice... And everything nice. These were the ingredients chosen to create the perfect pet creatures. But Professor HippoMaster accidentally added an extra ingredient to the concoction... Chemical X! Thus the Mutant Creatures were born!

Add Chemical X to the game, a mutinagenic that can be thrown at most Vanilla mobs, and turn them into super powered mutant versions of themselves. Mutant creatures *can* spawn naturally, but it is very rare.

##MystCraft 0.10.14.0 by XCompWiz

Adds the ability to generate new dimensions within the game from various properties that you discover while exploring Minecraft. Properties are discovered as pages, which you then combine into books, which can be used to transport you to the dimension that the book describes.

The mod is quite varied, and the dimensions have many new environment types that you cannot discover in vanila mincraft. The dimensions that you create can be extremely rich in resources, or terribly dangerous wastelands. They can even be completely unstable dimensions that are literally torn apart before your eyes.

##Tinkers Construct 1.6.0d40 by mDiyo

Tinkers' Construct is a mod about putting tools together in a wide variety of ways, then modifying them until they turn into something else. The tools never disappear and can be named and changed to your heart's desire. Once you make them, they're yours forever. Any world generation included in the mod is more efficient, but not required to progress.

##Treecapitator 2.0.3 by bspkrs

This mod allows you to chop down an entire tree (leaves and all) by harvesting one of its logs. Based on Terraria tree-cutting style. Basically, the larger the tree, the longer it will take to break the single log which topples the entire thing. This doesn't make it any faster to harvest the blocks, but it removes the time to nerd pole up to reach each one.

##What am I looking at (Waila) 1.5.3a by ProfMobius

Waila is an extension for NEI. It will show in the tooltip what mod an item is from. Since the tooltip contains the mod name, you can also easly parse items per mods. But that's not all ! Leveraging an extended NEI HUD, it is also capable of showing the name of blocks and mods ingame, right on top of your screen. If this is not enough, it comes with a few integrated modules to show internal information of some specific blocks. For now, BC tanks have been implemented (shows the content, capacity and amount of fluid) and IC2 machines (shows the In/out voltage).

How to use: It's pretty much automatic. Although you can bring up the Waila menu with numpad 0, and enable / disable it with numpad 1.

##Witchery 0.20.0 by Emoniph

Witchery provides several branches of witchcraft for a new witch or warlock to try their hand at. Witchcraft does not really resemble the flashy spell-casting performed by wizards and their ilk. There are no lightning wands or spell books, enchanted armor or flaming swords; instead, a well tended witch's garden will provide a lot of helpful ingredients for magic that will get you out of the occasional scrape.

There are of course darker sides to magic; and although these may bring power more quickly, the cost may be too high. Making bargains with demons should never be undertaken lightly!
