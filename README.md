##Treecapitator 2.0.2 by bspkrs

This mod allows you to chop down an entire tree (leaves and all) by harvesting one of its logs. Based on Terraria tree-cutting style. Basically, the larger the tree, the longer it will take to break the single log which topples the entire thing. This doesn't make it any faster to harvest the blocks, but it removes the time to nerd pole up to reach each one.

##Twilight Forest 2.0.3 by Benimatic

Imagine stepping through a portal into a twilight realm, filled with trees as far as they eye can see.  Breathtaking vistas and amazing discoveries await you around every corner.  But beware!  Not all denizens of the forest respond to your intrusion lightly.

This mod adds an incredibly rich dimension, with new and unique biomes, many many new creatures (both passive and aggressive), and a myriad of dungeons to explore.

##What am I looking at (Waila) 1.5.2 by ProfMobius

Waila is an extension for NEI. It will show in the tooltip what mod an item is from. Since the tooltip contains the mod name, you can also easly parse items per mods. But that's not all ! Leveraging an extended NEI HUD, it is also capable of showing the name of blocks and mods ingame, right on top of your screen. If this is not enough, it comes with a few integrated modules to show internal information of some specific blocks. For now, BC tanks have been implemented (shows the content, capacity and amount of fluid) and IC2 machines (shows the In/out voltage).

How to use: It's pretty much automatic. Although you can bring up the Waila menu with numpad 0, and enable / disable it with numpad 1.
